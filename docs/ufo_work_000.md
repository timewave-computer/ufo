# UFO Integration with Osmosis - Work Plan

## Overview

The Universal Fast Orderer (UFO) project aims to create a lightweight consensus system that can replace CometBFT (formerly Tendermint) in Cosmos SDK applications. Developed by Timewave, UFO was specifically created to enhance and accelerate multi-chain test environments where standard CometBFT consensus introduces significant overhead and slow block times. This document outlines the work plan for implementing UFO and integrating it with the Osmosis blockchain.

## Project Goals

1. Create a minimal, in-memory BFT consensus system
2. Implement the ABCI++ interface for Cosmos SDK compatibility
3. Provide gRPC and HTTP/JSON-RPC servers for client interaction
4. Develop both mock and real integrations with Osmosis
5. Create a CLI for interacting with the system

## Integration Approach

The integration approach involves two main components:

### 1. UFO Core

Provides the consensus layer for the Osmosis blockchain, replacing CometBFT:
- Handles transaction ordering
- Manages validator set
- Provides RPC interfaces compatible with CometBFT
- Maintains blockchain state

### 2. Bridge

Connects UFO to the Osmosis application:
- Translates ABCI calls to Osmosis application methods
- Manages initialization of the Osmosis application
- Provides compatibility layer for Cosmos SDK
- Handles transaction decoding and encoding

## Integration Options

Our implementation supports two integration modes:

### 1. Mock Mode

- Uses our simplified, in-memory implementation of Osmosis functionality
- Good for testing and development
- No external dependencies required
- Simplified transaction validation and processing

### 2. Bridged Mode

- Connects to a real Osmosis application instance
- Utilizes all real Osmosis modules and functionality
- Maintains compatibility with existing Osmosis transactions
- Full support for complex Osmosis operations

### 3. Patch-Based Integration

- Applies patches to the Osmosis codebase using Nix
- Replaces CometBFT dependencies with UFO interfaces
- Allows direct modification of Osmosis source code
- Ensures reproducible builds with specific Osmosis versions
- Keeps the UFO repository clean by storing only patches, not the entire Osmosis codebase

## Patch Management

Patches for Osmosis are stored in the `patches/osmosis` directory and managed through a Nix flake. This approach offers several benefits:

1. **Maintainability**: Only store the changes needed to integrate with UFO, not the entire Osmosis codebase
2. **Reproducibility**: Nix guarantees that the same inputs produce the same outputs
3. **Version Control**: Easily track changes to the patches over time
4. **Flexibility**: Apply patches to different versions of Osmosis as needed

To work with patches:

1. Clone the Osmosis repository at the specified version
2. Apply the patches using `nix build -f patches/osmosis`
3. Or create new patches using `scripts/generate_osmosis_patch.sh`
